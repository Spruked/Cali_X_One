## Intent to File Patent Applications

This document serves as formal notice of intent to file patent applications for the core innovations and technologies implemented in the Cali X One Super-Knowledge Graph AGI System.

## Core Innovations to be Patented

### 1. Recursive Super-Knowledge Graph Architecture
- **Description:** Multi-layered knowledge graph with automatic predicate invention and cross-domain reasoning
- **Novel Aspects:** 
  - Recursive predicate generation based on cluster analysis
  - Cross-user evidence accumulation for predicate validation
  - Sub-50ms processing for real-time AGI operations

### 2. Autonomous Predicate Invention Algorithms
- **Description:** AI system that automatically discovers and creates new semantic relationships
- **Novel Aspects:**
  - Density-based cluster analysis for relationship discovery
  - Semantic invention rules (entails, relies_on, contradicts)
  - Cross-domain lexicon analysis for relationship mapping

### 3. AGI Curiosity Daemon Systems
- **Description:** Self-directed research and exploration system for AGI
- **Novel Aspects:**

### 4. Cross-Domain Abstract Reasoning Frameworks
- **Description:** Framework for connecting concepts across different domains
- **Novel Aspects:**
  - Domain boundary detection and crossing algorithms
  - Abstract relationship mapping between disparate knowledge domains
  - Contradiction detection and resolution

### 5. Bootstrap Cascade Intelligence Emergence
- **Description:** Self-bootstrapping intelligence growth through recursive knowledge expansion
- **Novel Aspects:**
  - Trigger-based recursive expansion algorithms
  - Knowledge threshold detection for bootstrap activation
  - Emergent intelligence through predicate invention cycles
