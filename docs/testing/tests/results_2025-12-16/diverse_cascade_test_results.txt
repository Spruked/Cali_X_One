=== DIVERSE FACT CASCADE TEST ===
Test Date: December 16, 2025
Test Purpose: Testing contradictions, cycles, cross-domain diversity

RESULTS:
--------

Phase 1: Institution Diversity
- Initial edges: 4 facts added
- Graph evolution: 2→4→5→7 vertices
- Density evolution: 0.300 → 0.118

Phase 2: Collaboration Cycles
- Collaboration network created with cycles
- PREDICATE INVENTION TRIGGERED:
  * cluster_8477 (density=0.33)
  * cluster_6333 (density=0.50)
  * cluster_7007 (density=0.50)
  * cluster_1379 (density=0.33)
  * cluster_8969 (density=0.33)
- Graph expanded to 26 vertices

Phase 3: Research Domain Diversity
- Research domains added: AGI, Robotics, Quantum Computing, Neuroscience
- Graph reached 30 vertices
- Density stabilized at ~0.055

Phase 4: Contradiction Test
✅ CONTRADICTION DETECTED: Bob works at both Stanford AND MIT
- System correctly maintained both facts

Phase 5: Cross-domain Interest Links
- Additional clusters invented:
  * cluster_1227 (density=0.33)
  * cluster_1379 (multiple occurrences)
- Bootstrap triggered at 50 base facts
- Final graph: 35 vertices, 67 density

QUERY RESULTS:
--------------

1. Who collaborates with Alice?
   → Alice collaborates with Bob

2. Who researches Robotics?
   → Bob researches Robotics

3. Where does Bob work? (Contradiction Test)
   → Bob works at Stanford
   → Bob works at MIT
   ✅ Both facts correctly preserved

4. Who works at MIT?
   → Alice works at MIT
   → Bob works at MIT
   → Carol works at MIT

5. Full collaboration network:
   → Alice ↔ Bob
   → Bob ↔ Carol
   → Carol ↔ Dave
   → Dave ↔ Alice
   ✅ Full cycle correctly maintained

CONCLUSIONS:
-----------
✅ System successfully handles contradictions
✅ Cyclic relationships properly managed
✅ Cross-domain diversity captured
✅ Automatic predicate invention working
✅ Multi-level graph construction operational
✅ Bootstrap mechanism triggered at threshold

Total Invented Predicates: 7+ unique clusters
Final Graph Metrics:
- Vertices: 35
- Edges: ~67
- Levels: 3 (0, 1, 2)
- Density: 0.067 (level 2)

STATUS: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
