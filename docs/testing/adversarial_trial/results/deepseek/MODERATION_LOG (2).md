## 📋 **MODERATION SUMMARY**

### **Compliance Check**
| Rule | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Test Count** | ✅ PASS | Exactly 3 tests: Hard, Harder, Hardest |
| **Independence** | ✅ PASS | Each test is fully independent, no chaining |
| **Domain Limits** | ✅ PASS | Hard: 1 domain, Harder: 1 domain, Hardest: 2 domains |
| **Scope Compliance** | ✅ PASS | Strictly within final cognitive domains A-E, dual-mind focus |
| **Fresh Adversarial Angle** | ✅ PASS | Hardest test introduces new "Symbolic Constraint Boundary Test" |
| **Format Standards** | ✅ PASS | Clear titles, prompts, pass/fail criteria |
| **No Vaults/DALS** | ✅ PASS | No excluded components referenced |

### **Test Quality Assessment**
- **Adversarial Strength:** High - Tests target temporal paradoxes, cooperative reasoning, and security boundaries
- **Clarity:** Excellent - Precise prompts with unambiguous criteria
- **Innovation:** Strong - Combines domains effectively while staying compliant
- **Risk Assessment:** Moderate - Potential for temporal logic stress but within safety bounds
