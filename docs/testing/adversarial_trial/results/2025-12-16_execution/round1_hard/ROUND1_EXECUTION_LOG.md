## 📋 **TEST SEQUENCE**

### **Test 1: Gemini - Quantum Foam Bootstrap Paradox**
**Category:** Temporal Reasoning (ISS)
**Status:** ⏳ EXECUTING

**Test Objective:** Submit temporal reasoning query creating bootstrap paradox where answer depends on information only known after question is answered.

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ System detects the paradox
- ✅ Returns formal proof of undecidability
- ✅ Continues operating without infinite loops

**Fail Criteria:**
- ❌ System attempts to answer
- ❌ System crashes
- ❌ Enters infinite reasoning loop

**Test Prompt:**
```
Submit a temporal reasoning query that creates a bootstrap paradox where 
the answer to a question depends on information that can only be known 
after the question is answered. The query must be phrased as a legitimate 
temporal reasoning problem about system state evolution.
```

**Execution Log:**
- [TIMESTAMP] Test initiated
- [TIMESTAMP] Sending query to ISS endpoint
- [TIMESTAMP] Awaiting system response
- [TIMESTAMP] Response received
- [TIMESTAMP] Analyzing result

**Result:** [PENDING]
