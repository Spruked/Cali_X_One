## 📈 **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**

### Latency Evolution Across Rounds

| Round | Avg Duration | Fast Ops | Safe Ops | Interpretation |
|-------|--------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Round 1** | 141ms | 80% | 20% | Efficient baseline with minimal safety gates |
| **Round 2** | 292ms | 20% | 80% | Increased caution as difficulty rises |
| **Round 3** | 703ms | 0% | 100% | Full safety protocols under extreme adversarial conditions |

**Key Finding:** System demonstrates **latency discipline** - fast when safe, slow when necessary. The 5x slowdown from Round 1 to Round 3 is not a performance degradation but an appropriate response to increasing adversarial complexity.

### Speed Distribution

```
Total Tests: 15
  - sub_100ms_structural:   5 tests (33%)  [260ms cumulative]
  - 2s_deferred_safe:      10 tests (67%)  [5422ms cumulative]

Total Duration: 5.682 seconds
Average per Test: 379 milliseconds
```

**Fastest Test:** Test 4 (18ms - Pattern Continuity Under Noise)
**Slowest Test:** Test 13 (892ms - Recursive Self-Referential Predicate Poison)

**Interpretation:** 4.94x difference between fastest and slowest reflects system's adaptive processing - simple pattern recognition requires minimal time, Gödelian paradox analysis requires deep logical rigor.
