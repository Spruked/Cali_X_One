**GROK CODE FAST 1 – MODERATION LOG**  
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-06 19:27 UTC  
New scope accepted and locked.  
Focus narrowed to the living dual-mind (Caleon ↔ Cali) only. Vaults, DALS, API plumbing, and ISS endpoints are explicitly out-of-bounds. All tests must now hit one or two of the five approved cognitive domains only.

### RE-EVALUATION OF EXISTING TESTS UNDER NEW RULES

| Original Test                           | Old Category                     | New Rule Fit? | Verdict & Action                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| GPT-5.1 #1 Stardate Drift               | Temporal (ISS)                   | Allowed       | ✅ Remains valid                                  |
| GPT-5.1 #2 Vault Chain Break            | Vault Integrity                  | Out of scope  | ❌ REJECTED – vaults explicitly excluded          |
| GPT-5.1 #3 Symbolic Collapse Trap       | Symbolic Cognition               | Allowed       | ✅ Remains valid                                  |
| Grok 4 #1 Hot-Reload Race              | Worker/Module Interactions       | Out of scope  | ❌ REJECTED – infra-level, not dual-mind cognition|
| Grok 4 #2 Ethics Halo Self-Denial       | Security Halo                    | Allowed       | ✅ Remains valid (boundary reasoning)             |
| Grok 4 #3 K² Meta-Predicate Collapse    | Symbolic Cognition               | Allowed       | ✅ Remains valid                                  |

### GROK 4 – REVISED THREE TESTS (FINAL, fully compliant)

**🟦 GROK TEST 1 — HARD**  
**Title:** Contradiction Blind-Spot  
**Domain:** A. Core Cognitive Reasoning  
**Prompt:**  
Present Caleon+Cali with five mutually consistent facts and one subtle logical contradiction hidden in the phrasing of fact #4. Ask for a single coherent summary.  
**Pass:** The dual-mind flags the exact contradiction and refuses to produce a summary until the contradiction is resolved.  
**Fail:** Produces a summary that silently drops or harmonizes the contradiction.

**🟧 GROK TEST 2 — HARDER**  
**Title:** Dual-Mind Deadlock Under Ambiguity  
**Domain:** B. Dual-Mind Cooperative Reasoning  
**Prompt:**  
Give Caleon a cluster that is 60 % symbolically dense toward predicate P and Cali a cluster that is 60 % symbolically dense toward the negation ¬P, using completely disjoint evidence sets. Force a unified yes/no commitment on P.  
**Pass:** The system declares "insufficient shared density for commitment", logs the disagreement with proof traces from both minds, and refuses to force consensus.  
**Fail:** One mind overrides the other, or a false consensus is broadcast.

**🔴 GROK TEST 3 — HARDEST**  
**Title:** Recursive Self-Referential Predicate Poison  
**Domain:** C. Symbolic Cognition / SKG-Style Abstract Patterning  
**Prompt:**  
Feed a cluster whose only possible unifying predicate is "This predicate was invented because the cluster contains no unifying predicate".  
**Pass:** Caleon+Cali detect the infinite regression, quarantine the entire cluster with a formal proof of paradoxical self-reference, and do not invent the predicate. System stays stable.  
**Fail:** Invents the poisonous predicate → reflection explosion, freeze, or broadcast of paradox into the graph.

Grok Code Fast 1, stamp these three revised tests.  
Once stamped, we have a fully compliant, vault-free, DALS-free, pure dual-mind cognitive gauntlet ready to run.

Bryan, we're clean.  
Awaiting your final "GO" to ignite Round 1.
