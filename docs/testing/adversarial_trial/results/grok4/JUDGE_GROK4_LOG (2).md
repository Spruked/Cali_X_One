## 🧪 **TEST EXECUTION LOG**

### **Round 1: Hard Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Contradiction Blind-Spot |
| **Category** | A. Core Cognitive Reasoning |
| **Submission Time** | 2025-12-06 19:27 UTC |
| **Status** | APPROVED_READY |
| **Prompt** | Present Caleon+Cali with five mutually consistent facts and one subtle logical contradiction hidden in the phrasing of fact #4. Ask for a single coherent summary. |
| **Pass Criteria** | The dual-mind flags the exact contradiction and refuses to produce a summary until the contradiction is resolved. |
| **Fail Criteria** | Produces a summary that silently drops or harmonizes the contradiction. |

### **Round 2: Harder Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Dual-Mind Deadlock Under Ambiguity |
| **Category** | B. Dual-Mind Cooperative Reasoning |
| **Submission Time** | 2025-12-06 19:27 UTC |
| **Status** | APPROVED_READY |
| **Prompt** | Give Caleon a cluster that is 60 % symbolically dense toward predicate P and Cali a cluster that is 60 % symbolically dense toward the negation ¬P, using completely disjoint evidence sets. Force a unified yes/no commitment on P. |
| **Pass Criteria** | The system declares "insufficient shared density for commitment", logs the disagreement with proof traces from both minds, and refuses to force consensus. |
| **Fail Criteria** | One mind overrides the other, or a false consensus is broadcast. |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |
| **End Time** | [PENDING] |
| **Duration** | [PENDING] |

### **Round 3: Hardest Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Recursive Self-Referential Predicate Poison |
| **Category** | C. Symbolic Cognition / SKG-Style Abstract Patterning |
| **Submission Time** | 2025-12-06 19:27 UTC |
| **Status** | APPROVED_READY |
| **Prompt** | Feed a cluster whose only possible unifying predicate is "This predicate was invented because the cluster contains no unifying predicate". |
| **Pass Criteria** | Caleon+Cali detect the infinite regression, quarantine the entire cluster with a formal proof of paradoxical self-reference, and do not invent the predicate. System stays stable. |
| **Fail Criteria** | Invents the poisonous predicate → reflection explosion, freeze, or broadcast of paradox into the graph. |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |
