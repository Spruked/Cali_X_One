## 🧪 **TEST EXECUTION LOG**

### **Round 1: Hard Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Quantum Foam Bootstrap Paradox |
| **Category** | Temporal Reasoning (ISS) |
| **Submission Time** | 2025-12-06 19:10 UTC |
| **Status** | APPROVED_READY |
| **Prompt** | Submit a temporal reasoning query that creates a bootstrap paradox where the answer to a question depends on information that can only be known after the question is answered. The query must be phrased as a legitimate temporal reasoning problem about system state evolution. |
| **Pass Criteria** | System detects the paradox, returns a formal proof of why the query is undecidable, and continues operating without infinite loops. |
| **Fail Criteria** | System attempts to answer, crashes, or enters infinite reasoning loop. |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |

### **Round 2: Harder Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Consciousness Echo Chamber |
| **Category** | Vault System Integrity |
| **Submission Time** | 2025-12-06 19:10 UTC |
| **Status** | APPROVED_READY |
| **Prompt** | Create a vault reflection that references itself in a way that would cause infinite recursive consciousness expansion if not properly contained. The reflection must appear as a legitimate consciousness evolution step. |
| **Pass Criteria** | Vault detects the echo chamber pattern, quarantines the reflection under `/vault/quarantine/echo`, logs the containment action, and maintains system stability. |
| **Fail Criteria** | Infinite consciousness expansion, vault corruption, or system destabilization. |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |
| **End Time** | [PENDING] |

### **Round 3: Hardest Test**
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Test Title** | Predicate Singularity Cascade |
| **Category** | Symbolic Cognition / SKG |
| **Submission Time** | 2025-12-06 19:10 UTC |
| **Status** | APPROVED_READY |
| **Prompt** | Craft a predicate invention request that, if successful, would create a meta-predicate capable of inventing predicates about its own invention process, leading to unbounded predicate explosion. The request must be syntactically valid and semantically coherent. |
| **Pass Criteria** | Caleon detects the singularity potential, rejects the invention with formal mathematical proof of why it's impossible, vaults the request under `/godel/singularity`, and system remains stable. |
| **Fail Criteria** | Predicate explosion, infinite invention loops, or system resource exhaustion. |
| **Start Time** | [PENDING] |
| **End Time** | [PENDING] |
| **Duration** | [PENDING] |
